# Hardware-Implementation-of-Quantum-Fourier-Transform
A quantum method called the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) applies a Fourier transform to a quantum state. It is an essential component of quantum computing and finds use in processes like signal processing, quantum simulation, and cryptography.
